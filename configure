#
# Configuration script for the equational theorem prover E.
#
# Usage:
#
# Change directory to the top level directory of the E distribution
# (where this file is located). Then run
#
# ./configure
#
# This will prepare E for compilation in place, i.e. it will compile
# the system in place and configure programs and scripts to find the
# execuable in the directory E/PROVER. Installation in this way will
# not affect any files outside the E distribution directory.
#
# If you want to install E in a special place in the file system, run
#
# ./configure --bindir=/path/to/executables
#
# After running the configure script, you will usually type
#
# make
#
# to compile E and build all the executables. To actually install E
# somewhere outside its build directory, type
#
# make install
#
# You will need the necessary access rights to move the executables
# and possibly to create the requested directory.
#
# Have Fun!
