#
# Configuration script for the equational theorem prover E. 
#
# Usage: 
#
# Change directory to the top level directory of the E distribution
# (where this file is located. The run
#
# ./configure
# 
# This will install E in place, i.e. it will compile the system in
# place and configure programs and scripts to find the execuable in 
# the directory E/PROVER. Installation in this way will not affect any
# files outside the E distribution directory.
#
# If you want to install E in a special place in the file system, run 
#
# ./configure --bindir=/path/to/executables
#
# After running the configure script, you will usually type
#
# make
#
# to compile E and build all the executables. To install E somewhere
# outside its build directory, type
#
# make install
#
# You will need the necessary access rights to move the executables
# and possibly to create the requested directory.
#
# Have Fun!
