Short Installation Instructions for the Impatient
-------------------------------------------------

This assumes that you have GNU tar, bash and gawk in your search path!

Simple installation (will install executables):

> tar -xzf E.tgz 
> cd E
> vi Makefile.vars
> Set EXECPATH to the directory the programs should live in
> make install
> make install-exec
> /path/to/EXECDIR/eprover -h | more

Simplest installation (in-place):

> tar -xzf E.tgz 
> cd E
> make install
> cd PROVER
> eprover -h | more

This will only allow you to run the eproof script in place (most other
programs, including eprover, are stand-alone binaries and should run
from everywhere).

Read the rest of this file and the fine (if incomplete) manual if
anything fails. There should be a copy in DOC/eprover.pdf.



             The Equational Theorem Prover E
             ===============================


This is the README file for version 0.99 "Singtom" of the E equational
theorem prover. This version of E is free software, see the file
COPYING for details about the license and the fact that THERE IS NO
WARRANTY!  

Release 0.99 introduces an improved automatic mode, clause splitting
via explicit definitions, and better goal-directed heuristics For more
on new features, read DOC/NEWS.

If you are using certain gcc 2.95.1, 2.96.X, 2.97.X or 3.2.X releases,
you may or may not experience strange bugs. In that case, please read
DOC/PORTING for important information (Hint: Get a new compiler. Yes,
there are workarounds).


What is E? What is CLIB?
------------------------

E is an equational theorem prover. That means it is a program that you
can stuff a mathematical specification (in first-order logic with
equality) and a hypothesis into, and which will then run forever,
using up all of your machines resources. Very occasionally it will
find a proof for the hypothesis and tell you so ;-).

CLIB is a collection of library functions for building one class of
interesting and cool programs. Interesting and cool programs read an
input file (or multiple files), process the input, and print a result,
or they are games. Examples for cool and interesting programs are
DISCOUNT (a distributed theorem prover), proof (a proof transformation
tool), DOOM (a game) and xevil (also a game). The sole exception to
this rule is EMACS, which is interesting and cool despite being
interactive and not a game. But it has a LISP interpreter, which is
very much like a game....

At the moment CLIB is more suited for theorem provers and similar
programs, and less useful for games. This will probably change as soon
as the game potential of theorem provers is recognized.

CLIB is layered, with higher layers becoming more specialized. Lower
levels take care of the scientifically uninteresting, but necessary
services for production-quality efficient programs, e.g. error
handling, memory management, parsing of input, etc. They should be
useful for most programs (even for some interactive programs).

Higher level modules implement shared and unshared terms, equations,
clauses and related stuff.

My aim in writing this library is to ease the development of E and a
couple of auxiliary programs. While I try to keep new features useful
for other purposes, this aim determines which features I myself will
add. In fact, E and CLIB are now so intertwined that you will not find
a pure CLIB anymore.

CLIB and E have been created and are currently maintained by Stephan
Schulz, <schulz@eprover.org>. They are developed and distributed under
the GNU General Public License. However, you may possibly come around
versions sold or given to you under a different license, probably by
Safelogic A.B. in Gothenburg, Sweden. For some time, Safelogic paid
for the right to distribute (and relicense) closed-source versions of
E with proprietary modifications.

The E homepage can be found at http://www.eprover.org


Installation:
-------------

E can be installed anywhere in the file system, either by a normal
user or by the system administrator.

To install the package, unpack the distribution (if you are reading
this, you probably already did):

  gunzip -c E.tgz|tar -xvf - 

  or 

  (g)tar -xzf E.tgz   (if you have GNU tar)

This should create a directory named E. After unpacking, edit
E/Makefile.vars to your liking. In particular, if building for HPUX,
comment out the suitable CFLAGS definition (for most systems, the
default definition should be ok).

  cd E
  make install

to compile and install the library and all included programs under the
E directory. If you want to use the wrapper script "eproof" anywhere
except in the E/PROVER directory, set the EXECPATH variable in
Makefile.vars to a suitable directory and type

  make install-exec

Type 

  make documentation

to translate the rudimentary LaTeX documentation (this requires
LaTeX2e, pdflatex, and the packages theorem, amssymb and epsfig, which
are included in most current LaTeX distributions). For some operating
systems, especially if you do not have the GNU gcc compiler installed,
you may need to edit Makefile.vars to select tools and options. If you
have any problems, look into E/DOC/PORTING.

After installation, go to E/PROVER and type 

  ./eprover BOO001-1+rm_eq_rstfp.lop

to see the prover in action. Type 

  ./eprover LUSK6.lop

for a harder example. "./eprover -h" will give you some information and
a list of options.

For impatient people who do not want to read anything: 

  eprover -tAuto -xAuto --memory-limit=<80%_of_your_main_memory> <problem-file> 

should give a reasonable performance on a large class of problems
(unless your main memory is really small).

One of the newer features of E is the ability to produce semi-readable
proofs. To use this, type

  eprover -l4 <other-stuff> | epclextract

or use the wrapper-script

  eproof <any options> problem

You can check the output of epclextract (and eproof) for correctness
using the tool checkproof in the same directory. "checkproof -h"
should give you all necessary information.
