Short Installation Instructions for the impatient
-------------------------------------------------

This assumes that you have GNU tar, sh and gawk in your search path!

Simple installation (will install executables):

> tar -xzf E.tgz
> cd E
> ./configure --bindir=/path/to/EXECDIR
> make
> make install
> /path/to/EXECDIR/eprover -h | more

Simplest installation (in-place):

> tar -xzf E.tgz
> cd E
> ./configure
> make
> cd PROVER
> eprover -h | more

Read the rest of this file and the fine (if incomplete) manual if
anything fails. There should be a copy of the manual in
DOC/eprover.pdf.

The recommended command for running E on the file problem.p is

  eprover --auto --proof-object problem.p

If you want to try the usually stronger strategy scheduling mode, use

  eprover --auto-schedule --tptp3-in --proof-object problem.p

You can add a time limit of 300 seconds with the option
--cpu-limit=300 and a memory limit of 2 GB with --memory-limit=2048
for all "automatic" modes. You can reduce output with -s (or
--silent). As of version 1.9.1, E will try to auto-detect the input
format and adjust the output format accordingly. You can still force
input and output formats via commandline options.



             The Equational Theorem Prover E
             ===============================


This is the README file for version 2.0 "Turzum" of the E equational
theorem prover. This version of E is free software, see the file
COPYING for details about the license and the fact that THERE IS NO
WARRANTY!

Release 2 contains several major changes and improvements. The most
significant user-visible change is that E now supports the TFF (typed
first-order form), although not (yet) interpreted arithmetic. Most of
the work to support TFF was done by Simon Cruanes - thanks! E now also
handles some formulas with large quantifier prefixes more efficiently,
and does degrade more gracefully in the worst case.

Search behaviour was improved with changes to the automatic mode, and
strategy-scheduling has moved from experimental to (hopefully) stable.


What is E?
----------

E is an equational theorem prover. That means it is a program that you
can stuff a mathematical specification (in first-order logic with
equality) and a hypothesis into, and which will then run forever,
using up all of your machines resources. Very occasionally it will
find a proof for the hypothesis and tell you so ;-).

E has been created and is currently maintained by Stephan Schulz,
<schulz@eprover.org>. It is developed and distributed under the GNU
General Public License. However, you may possibly come around versions
sold or given to you under a different license, probably by Safelogic
A.B. in Gothenburg, Sweden. For some time, Safelogic paid for the
right to distribute (and relicense) closed-source versions of E with
proprietary modifications.

The E homepage can be found at http://www.eprover.org


Installation:
-------------

E can be installed anywhere in the file system, either by a normal
user or by the system administrator.

To install the package, unpack the distribution (if you are reading
this, you probably already did):

  gunzip -c E.tgz|tar -xvf -

  or

  (g)tar -xzf E.tgz   (if you have GNU tar)

This should create a directory named E. After unpacking, optionally
edit E/Makefile.vars to your liking. In particular, if building for
HPUX, comment out the suitable CFLAGS definition (for most systems,
the default definition should be ok). Then change to the E directory:

  cd E

Determine if you want to run E from it's own build directory or wether
you want to install the executables in some other directory
EXECDIR. In the first case, run

   ./configure

otherwise

   ./configure --bindir=EXECDIR

or, if you also want to install the man-pages into MANDIR,

   ./configure --bindir=EXECDIR --man-prefix=MANDIR

Then type

   make

to compile the library and all included programs under the E
directory. If you want to install E in a particular EXECDIR, type

  make install

You must have write permission in the EXECDIR, so if you install E
outside your own home directory, you may need to become root or use
sudo.

Type

  make documentation

to translate the rudimentary LaTeX documentation (this requires
LaTeX2e, pdflatex, and the packages theorem, amssymb and epsfig, which
are included in most current LaTeX distributions).

For some operating systems, especially if you do not have the GNU gcc
compiler installed, you may need to edit Makefile.vars manually to
select tools and options. If you have any problems, look into
E/DOC/PORTING.

If you get into trouble,

   make rebuild

will rebuild E completely to your current configuration.

After installation, go to E/PROVER and type

  ./eprover BOO001-1+rm_eq_rstfp.lop

to see the prover in action. Type

  ./eprover LUSK6.lop

for a harder example. "./eprover -h" will give you some information and
a list of options.

For impatient people who do not want to read anything:

  eprover --auto --memory-limit=<80%_of_your_main_memory> <problem-file>

should give a reasonable performance on a large class of problems
(unless your main memory is really small).

The new auto mode will perform a heuristic pruning of the axiom set
which may result in incompleteness for very large problems (many
thousands of axioms). If you need completeness, use

  eprover --satauto --memory-limit=<80%_of_your_main_memory> <problem-file>

In general, different proof problems are easy for different
strategies. If you run

  eprover --auto-schedule --memory-limit=<80%_of_your_main_memory> <problem-file>

or

  eprover --satauto-schedule --memory-limit=<80%_of_your_main_memory> <problem-file>

the prover will try a series of strategies on the problem. It assumes
a 300 second run time - if you impose a different one externally, it
is important to let E know via the --cpu-limit=XXX option so that it
can adjust the schedule.

One of the features of E is the ability to produce semi-readable
proofs. To use this, type

  eprover --proof-object <other-stuff>

By default, E will now automatically detect the input format (LOP,
TPTP-2 or TPTP-3), and will select the matching output format (PCL2
for LOP and TPTP-2 inputs, TPTP-3 for TPTP-3 inputs).

You can check the proof objects in PCL format for correctness using
the tool checkproof in the same directory. "checkproof -h" should give
you all necessary information. Note that checkproof cannot yet deal
with the full first order part, and will skip anything not
clausal. Also, support for independent provers in checkproof can be
subject to bit-rot, as other systems and interfaces change.

include:

  - Symbolic links to all user-relevant header files

  - Symbolic links to the individual library modules

devopment_tools:
  - Various tools for working with large scale experimental test runs,
