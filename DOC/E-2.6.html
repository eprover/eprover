<H3>Architecture</H3>

E 2.6 [Sch2002, Sch2013, SCV2019] is a purely equational theorem
prover for many-sorted first-order logic with equality, with some
extensions for higher-order logic.  It consists of an (optional)
clausifier for pre-processing full first-order formulae into clausal
form, and a saturation algorithm implementing an instance of the
superposition calculus with negative literal selection and a number of
redundancy elimination techniques. E is based on the DISCOUNT-loop
variant of the <EM>given-clause</EM> algorithm, i.e., a strict
separation of active and passive facts. No special rules for
non-equational literals have been implemented.  Resolution is
effectively simulated by paramodulation and equality resolution. As of
E 2.1, PicoSAT [Bie2008] can be used to periodically check the
(on-the-fly grounded) proof state for propositional unsatisfiability.
<P>
For the LTB divisions, a control program uses a SInE-like analysis to
extract reduced axiomatizations that are handed to several instances
of E. E will not use on-the-fly learning this year.


<H3>Strategies</H3>

Proof search in E is primarily controlled by a literal selection
strategy, a clause selection heuristic, and a simplification
ordering. The prover supports a large number of pre-programmed literal
selection strategies. Clause selection heuristics can be constructed
on the fly by combining various parameterized primitive evaluation
functions, or can be selected from a set of predefined
heuristics. Clause evaluation heuristics are based on symbol-counting,
but also take other clause properties into account. In particular, the
search can prefer clauses from the set of support, or containing many
symbols also present in the goal. Supported term orderings are several
parameterized instances of Knuth-Bendix-Ordering (KBO) and
Lexicographic Path Ordering (LPO), which can be lifted in different
ways to literal orderings.
<P>
For CASC-28, E implements a strategy-scheduling automatic mode.  The
total CPU time available is broken into several (unequal) time
slices. For each time slice, the problem is classified into one of
several classes, based on a number of simple features (number of
clauses, maximal symbol arity, presence of equality, presence of
non-unit and non-Horn clauses, possibly presence of certain axiom
patterns...). For each class, a schedule of strategies is greedily
constructed from experimental data as follows: The first strategy
assigned to a schedule is the the one that solves the most problems
from this class in the first time slice. Each subsequent strategy is
selected based on the number of solutions on problems not already
solved by a preceding strategy.
<p>
About 140 different strategies have been thoroughly evaluated on all
untyped first-order problems from TPTP 7.3.0. We have also explored
some parts of the heuristic parameter space with a short time limit of
5 seconds. This allowed us to test about 650 strategies on all TPTP
problems, and an extra 7000 strategies on UEQ problems from TPTP
7.2.0.

About 100 of these strategies are used in the automatic mode, and
about 450 are used in at least one schedule.


<H3>Implementation</H3>

E is build around perfectly shared terms, i.e. each distinct term is
only represented once in a term bank. The whole set of terms thus
consists of a number of interconnected directed acyclic graphs.  Term
memory is managed by a simple mark-and-sweep garbage collector.
Unconditional (forward) rewriting using unit clauses is implemented
using perfect discrimination trees with size and age constraints.
Whenever a possible simplification is detected, it is added as a
rewrite link in the term bank. As a result, not only terms, but also
rewrite steps are shared.  Subsumption and contextual literal cutting
(also known as subsumption resolution) is supported using feature
vector indexing [Sch2013a].  Superposition and backward rewriting use
fingerprint indexing [Sch2012], a new technique combining ideas from
feature vector indexing and path indexing.  Finally, LPO and KBO are
implemented using the elegant and efficient algorithms developed by
Bernd L&ouml;chner in [Loe2006, Loe2006a]. The prover and additional
information are available at

<H3>Expected Competition Performance</H3>

The inference core of E 2.6 has been slightly modified since last
years version. We have also been able to evaluate some more
different search strategies. As a result, we expect performance to be
somewhat better than in the last years, especially in UEQ. The system
is expected to perform well in most proof classes, but will at best
complement top systems in the disproof classes.
