.SH NAME
e_ltb_runner \- manual page for e_ltb_runner 3.1.0 Singbulli
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B e_ltb_runner
[\fI\,options\/\fR] [\fI\,Batchfile\/\fR] [\fI\,PATH_TO_EPROVER\/\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
e_ltb_runner 3.1.0 "Singbulli"
.PP
Read a CASC LTB batch specification file and process it.
.SH OPTIONS
.HP
\fB\-h\fR
.HP
\fB\-\-help\fR
.IP
Print a short description of program usage and options.
.HP
\fB\-V\fR
.HP
\fB\-\-version\fR
.IP
Print the version number of the prover. Please include this with all bug
reports (if any).
.HP
\fB\-v\fR
.HP
\fB\-\-verbose[=\fR<arg>]
.IP
Verbose comments on the progress of the program. This differs from the
output level (below) in that technical information is printed to stderr,
while the output level determines which logical manipulations of the
clauses are printed to stdout. The short form or the long form without
the optional argument is equivalent to \fB\-\-verbose\fR=\fI\,1\/\fR.
.HP
\fB\-o\fR <arg>
.HP
\fB\-\-output\-file=\fR<arg>
.IP
Redirect output into the named file.
.HP
\fB\-d\fR <arg>
.HP
\fB\-\-output\-dir=\fR<arg>
.IP
Directory for individual problem output files. Default is the current
working directory.
.HP
\fB\-\-variants27\fR
.IP
Handle different variants for each problem base name as required for
CASC\-27. This is very specific hack.
.HP
\fB\-\-variants28\fR
.IP
Handle different variants for each problem base name as required for
CASC\-28 (without higher\-order support). This is very specific hack.
.HP
\fB\-\-variants28\-ho\fR
.IP
Handle different variants for each problem base name as required for
CASC\-28, including the TH0\-variant. This is very specific hack. Note that
this requires eprover\-ho for the third variant.
.HP
\fB\-\-variants28\-25\fR
.IP
Handle different variants for each problem base name as required for
CASC\-28, but run E\-2.5 (prerelease) as the base prover. This is a really
very specific hack, to enable E 2.5 as the CASC\-J10 LTB winner to compete
in CASC\-28. It requires manual installation of the eprover\-2.5 binary in
the StarExec package.
.HP
\fB\-\-variantsj11\fR
.IP
Handle different variants for each problem base name as required for
CASC\-J11. See above.
.HP
\fB\-i\fR
.HP
\fB\-\-interactive\fR
.IP
For each batch file, enter interactive mode after processing batch the
batch problems. Interactive mode allows the processing of additional jobs
with respect to the loaded axioms set. Jobs are entered via stdin and
print to stdout.
.HP
\fB\-s\fR
.HP
\fB\-\-silent\fR
.IP
Equivalent to \fB\-\-output\-level\fR=\fI\,0\/\fR.
.HP
\fB\-l\fR <arg>
.HP
\fB\-\-output\-level=\fR<arg>
.IP
Select an output level, greater values imply more verbose output. Level 0
produces nearly no output, level 1 will output each clause as it is
processed, level 2 will output generating inferences, level 3 will give a
full protocol including rewrite steps and level 4 will include some
internal clause renamings. Levels >= 2 also imply PCL2 or TSTP formats
(which can be post\-processed with suitable tools).
.HP
\fB\-w\fR <arg>
.HP
\fB\-\-wtc\-limit=\fR<arg>
.IP
Set the global wall\-clock limit for each batch (if any).
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
.PP
Report bugs to <schulz@eprover.org>. Please include the following, if
possible:
.PP
* The version of the package as reported by \fBeprover \-\-version\fR.
.PP
* The operating system and version.
.PP
* The exact command line that leads to the unexpected behaviour.
.PP
* A description of what you expected and what actually happened.
.PP
* If possible all input files necessary to reproduce the bug.
