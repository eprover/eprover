[\fIoptions\fR] [\fIfiles\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
e_ltb_runner 1.6pre008 "Tiger Hill"
.PP
Read a CASC 23 LTB batch specification file and process it.
.SH OPTIONS

.HP
\fB\-h\fR
.HP
\fB\-\-help\fR
.IP
Print a short description of program usage and options.
.HP
\fB\-V\fR
.HP
\fB\-\-version\fR
.IP
Print the version number of the prover. Please include this with all bug
reports (if any).
.HP
\fB\-v\fR
.HP
\fB\-\-verbose[=\fR<arg>]
.IP
Verbose comments on the progress of the program. This differs from the
output level (below) in that technical information is printed to stderr,
while the output level determines which logical manipulations of the
clauses are printed to stdout. The short form or the long form without
the optional argument is equivalent to \fB\-\-verbose\fR=\fI1\fR.
.HP
\fB\-o\fR <arg>
.HP
\fB\-\-output\-file=\fR<arg>
.IP
Redirect output into the named file.
.HP
\fB\-s\fR
.HP
\fB\-\-silent\fR
.IP
Equivalent to \fB\-\-output\-level\fR=\fI0\fR.
.HP
\fB\-l\fR <arg>
.HP
\fB\-\-output\-level=\fR<arg>
.IP
Select an output level, greater values imply more verbose output. Level 0
produces nearly no output, level 1 will output each clause as it is
processed, level 2 will output generating inferences, level 3 will give a
full protocol including rewrite steps and level 4 will include some
internal clause renamings. Levels >= 2 also imply PCL2 or TSTP formats
(which can be post\-processed with suitable tools).
.HP
\fB\-w\fR <arg>
.HP
\fB\-\-wtc\-limit=\fR<arg>
.IP
Set the global wall\-clock limit for each batch (if any).
