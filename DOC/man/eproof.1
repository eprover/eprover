.SH SYNOPSIS
.B eproof
[\fIoptions\fR] \fI<file1> \fR...
.SH DESCRIPTION
eproof  1.6pre008 Tiger Hill
.PP
Eproof is a wrapper around E and epclextract. It will run E with
output level 4 (full output of all potentially proof\-relevant
inferences) and, in the case of success, automatically run epclextract
to provide a proof derivation or a derivation of all clauses in the
saturated proof state.
.PP
Please note that eproof, unlike most E tools, does not support reading
problems from stdin. It will silently assume an empty input from stdin.
.PP
Eproof will intercept the command line arguments and interprete certain
options as described below. All other options and arguments are passed
on to eprover or epclextract, as appropriate. See those tools help
pages for the supported options.
.PP
In particular, eproof will automatically do a close approximation of
\&'the right thing' (tm) with the options describing input\- and output
formats.
