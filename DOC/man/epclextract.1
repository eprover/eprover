.B epclextract
[\fI\,options\/\fR] [\fI\,files\/\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
epclextract 3.1.0
.PP
Read an PCL2 protocol and print the steps necessary for proving the clauses in "proof", "final", or "extract" steps.
.PP
Options
.HP
\fB\-h\fR
.HP
\fB\-\-help\fR
.IP
Print a short description of program usage and options.
.HP
\fB\-V\fR
.HP
\fB\-\-version\fR
.IP
Print the version number of the program.
.HP
\fB\-v\fR
.HP
\fB\-\-verbose[=\fR<arg>]
.IP
Verbose comments on the progress of the program. The short form or the
long form without the optional argument is equivalent to \fB\-\-verbose\fR=\fI\,1\/\fR.
.HP
\fB\-f\fR
.HP
\fB\-\-fast\-extract\fR
.IP
Do a fast extract. With this option the program understands only a subset
of PCL and assumes that all "proof" and "final" steps are at the end of
the protocoll.
.HP
\fB\-C\fR
.HP
\fB\-\-forward\-comments\fR
.IP
Pass comments found in the input through to the output while reading
input.
.HP

.IP
Print special "begin" and "end"comments around the proof object, as
required by the CASC MIX* class.
.HP
\fB\-n\fR
.HP
\fB\-\-no\-extract\fR
.IP
Don't extract, print back all steps (actually, it treats all steps as
proof steps). Useful as a syntax checker, or if you want to convert PCL
to TSTP with the next option.
.HP
\fB\-\-tstp\-out\fR
.IP
Print proof protocol in TSTP syntax (default is PCL).
.HP
\fB\-\-tptp3\-out\fR
.IP
Synonymous with \fB\-\-tstp\-out\fR.
.HP
\fB\-o\fR <arg>
.HP
\fB\-\-output\-file=\fR<arg>
.IP
Redirect output into the named file.
.HP
\fB\-s\fR
.HP
\fB\-\-silent\fR
.IP
Equivalent to \fB\-\-output\-level\fR=\fI\,0\/\fR.
