This is the required ReadMe file for the CASC competitions.
-----------------------------------------------------------

For installation, follow the instructions in the main README
file. Make sure to do a proper install, so that e_ltb_runner can find
the executables. If you need to rebuild a StarExec version from the
sources, run "make starexec-src", which should take care of
everything. Note that THIS WILL DELETE $(STAREXECPATH), which is by
default defined as $(HOME)/StarExecEBuild. Edit Makefile.vars to
choose a different directory for building the StarExec distribution.

The strategies for the different divisions are:

THF:           starexec_run_E---_THF
SLH:           starexec_run_E---_SLH
FOF UEQ:       starexec_run_E---_FOF_UEQ
TFN FNT:       starexec_run_E---_FNT

Distinguished strings for the results:

Problem is CNF and unsatisfiable:

# SZS status Unsatisfiable

Problem is CNF and satisfiable:

# SZS status Satisfiable

Problem is FOF/THF and a theorem:

# SZS status Theorem
or
# SZS status ContradictoryAxioms

Problem is FOF and not a theorem:

# SZS status CounterSatisfiable

System gave up (usually resource limit)

# Failure:


The start of solution output for proofs:

# SZS output start CNFRefutation.

The end of solution output for proofs:

# SZS output end CNFRefutation.


The start of solution output for models/saturations:

# SZS output start Saturation.

The end of solution output for models/saturations:

# SZS output end Saturation.
