Implements Bernd's KBO.

Purity. For the equational case, use non-E-unifiability as the
criterion (approximate it with universal equality). 

Condensing.

Finally get rid of the ugly second termbank. Just have two variable
banks per term bank, the Xs (normal variables) and the Ys (used when
distinct variables are needed. Possibly better sharing, more general
use of pointer compariasons, and ground term inserting becomes free.

Flattening of ground terms (anti-unfolding ;-), useful for termination
in many theories, and maybe in general.

Splitting with naming!

Contextual rewriting

Get rid of the ugly distinction between LHS top terms and other
terms. Now that simplification is driven from the clause level, it's
unecessary. Just annotate if a term was rewritten with a real
instance, and if not, set the flag temporarily and search for another
rewrite possibility. 

Use plain back propagation MLP for classification (n out of m
multiplexer, error measure: Difference from wanted result (-1 for bad,
1 for giid heuristics). For input of discrete features use individual
neurons. Can e.g. finally encode the UEQ <= HEQ <= GEQ (if that makes
sense...). Do a Python prototype soon!

Rippling-like annotated terms for E. 

Split only if clause has multiple inference literals. -> See below,
stupid!

Implement simple indexing for paramodulation. Idea: Processed clauses
get an _into_ and a _from_ index. Both are a simple PDArray_p indexed
by the top function symbol of the respective inference terms (or 0 for
variables - only in _from_ case). Each entry in the index is a
clb_objtrees, indexed by the clause, and containing all inference
positions in that clause that start with the indexed symbol.
- Should safe an enourmous amount of iteration - especially from
positions are very rare indeed! Will change generation order, though
(but not significantly). 

Try copying instantiated terms (non-shared) before doing ordering
comparisons -> we can count variable occurences in the variables!

Precedences giving different weights to frequencies in positive and
negative literals (positive more seems better).

Geoff's Idea: Goal-Directed heuristics, using similarity measures on
frequency vectors. Alternatively: Giving bonus for smaller features.
Simpler: Use frequency of symbols in goals to compute weights (symbols
in goals are preferred). -> Simple version now done.

Waldmeister-Style MixWeight: |max(s,t)| * (|s|+|t|+1) + |s| + |t|

Caching term orderings:

- Key: Only three kinds of instantiations (Never, Always, Once) ->
  allows caching for each value
- Cache in OCB (no additional arguments to pass)
- Cache is of term cells affected
- Term stores its cache entry in multi-function field (reuse
  rewrite_hack). Invariant: Field is NULL unless used (side effect:
  eleminate TPIsReplaced, use field instead)
- Cache entry: For KBO array of weighs, for LPO array of trees of
  other terms with comparison (key: (term, instatiation)).
- After comparisons for a given instantiation are done, call
  "ClearCache": Pop stack, delete cache entry for term, until stack is
  empty. 

Replace VarHash with simple PDArrays if time critical. As variables
idents are small in practice, should work with little memory overhead,
but much faster.

Perhaps put outputlevel and stream into proofstate? Allows for more
customization. Again perhaps: Give names to proofstates and termbanks
and prefix output about operations on a state with the name?

Improve distribute_eprover.awk: Insert included files at the correct
place in the command line, store logfile with job -> We can run
multiple test runs in one call of the script, and do not have to wait
for late jobs before starting the next parameter set.

Generate Term Orderings: 
a) Try to orient axioms (perhaps try to orient pos-units from larger
   to smaller terms, all other literals smaller to larger terms?)
   - partially done, without preferred orientations.
b) Run prover for n steps, take ordering which resulted in least
   amount of new clauses
c) For non-unit clauses: Only (or primarily) take positive literals
   (=potential rewrite rules) into account.

New Idea: Use "Trigger equations" with weight and ordering
constraints! 

Dynamically addjustable pick-given-ratio (test with Scheme first -->
test done, successful)
Syntax: n@m[+-*/]k  - initial value n
                    - every m processed clauses modify n by
		      adding/subtracting/multiplying with or
		      dividing by k
                    - Perhaps add limits?[a..b]?

Rethink Simweight...return something based on the comparison of equal
and unequal parts!


gettermweight() is somewhat inefficient. If we don't need the weight
multiplier, we can perhaps speed it up with a simple stack-based
algorithm -> Ask Joachim!

Consider unions to make term cells smaller

Sort clauses (ordering on term numbers or pointers?) and unoriented
equations, compare clauses, change clauseset to clause trees and keep
only one copy of identical clauses --- will be difficult and perhaps
unnecessary... (Probably won't do it -> now implemented for static
clauses and called at intervalls)

Extend index for literal subsumption? (Seems to be unnecessary)

Implement Vampire-like pseudo-KBO: Weight, Vars, Word-Lexicographic

Literal selection with P-Functions seems to work by inducing a fixed
order on negative condition processing. If this is the case, perhaps
we should not do selection for the case that there is only one
negative literal, or the fact that a unique negative literal is
maximal. On the other hand, perhaps we should use selection of
positive literals for the case of a single negative literal even if we
usually don't (yes, I do need to unify and rewrite all of the
selection module at some time. Thanks for reminding me!)

SelectComplexExceptRRHorn -> Check if the maximal literal is
orientable, check if rule is range restricted with respect to this
maximal term...


Select DiffNeg orientable literal

Select always unless UniqMaxPosOrientable (Waiting for results from
the above to decide on base selection strategy)

Select literals with variables not bound in any positive
literal. Alternatively, select maximal negative literal if it exists
(might have similar effect)

Rework literal selection. Three parameters: Do I select, which
negative one do I select, which positive one do I select (currently
thats either none or all). Perhaps even better: 4 Parameters - decide
on negative and positive selection individually. Do we want to select
positive literals for paramodulation into other clauses as well? New
selection concept?

Use index for paramodulation from processed clauses into new ones -
only needs maximal terms from maximal positive literals in clauses
without selection

If I need to touch all of this anyways: Get rid of the literal
selection hack (selected literals are somewhat maximal) and cleanly
separate these.


Implement weight function that uses different penalties for
unorientability of positive and negative literals -> Done, needs more
testing 

Trivial: If no equality is present, disable AC scanning in Auto
mode. -> Done

Rework KBO to be faster (see first entry)!

For orientable rewrite-rules, give a higher weight to minimal sides
than to maximal ones (prefer rules that decrease term size).

For split clauses, give the split literal the (default) weight of the
split off literals. Requires quite some work, as it touches most
evaluation functions, but should be worth it. -> Done for some
evaluation functions, thrown out again. To complex, doesn't seem to
help. 

Always select positive split literals if we select at all! Then
negative units can resolve against them...or we'd rather need a
special simplifying inference for that kind of situation. -> We need
this, and in general. It is complete (the resulting clause alone
implies the parent, and is smaller). On the third hand, see Vampire
paper in Proc. IJCAR for the different strategies implementable with
splitting. Also think about contextual rewriting! -> Done for the
simplification inference. Also read Alexandre's and Andrei's Paper!

Use ordering constraints on clauses generated from unorientable
literals or literals which are not uniquely maximal in the
clause. If we use a unit with contraints for rewriting and the
constraints to not evaluate to the trivial true case, we might need to
drop constraints.

Make some more measurements about relation of EqnCells to
TermCells. If we really need less than one TermCell per EqnCell for
hard problems, we should move the TermBank-Pointer from the EqnCell
into the TermCell. This also would make many debugging operations
simpler, because we have access to the signature from any shared term!

Sharing factor used introspectively!

Search for non-equational equivalences, add them as rewrite rules. Can
we generalize this to equational literals? Does it make sense there or
is it somehow subsumed by rewriting?

Try to select (or unselect?) sort predicates of the form -p(X) for
some p. On the plus side, may only instantiate X to terms of the
correct sort. On the down side, perhap we can only prove sort for very
specific instances and enumerate them. -> Done, never selecting them
is (usually) good!

For eground: Implement a special clause type taking up less
memory. Implement the incomplete grounder by just taking the
ungrounded system, instantiating everything to some constant (the most
frequent constant?) and copying the set. (partially done)

Literal sharing (with external sign?)! We can share lots of
operations: 
 - Unit subsumption and Simplify-Reflect
 - Select the same literal throughout the proof state (we can have
   local selection as well!). Problem: What happens if multiple
   literals are selected then? Possible answer: Then prefer only
   clauses with exactly one selected literal - if we solve this
   literal (at least in the Horn case), it should vanish everywhere!
   Or: Process only positive clauses and clauses with exactly one
   selected literal.

For eground:
- Move to explicit constraints _stored with the clause_
- Compute constraints before grounding, propagate to split clauses
- Use unification constraints in clauses as they are generated!
  I.e. use constraints from both clauses (might be more expensive, but
  probably worth it).

- Split only clauses with more than one inference literal -- nope, if
  it can be split at all, then there are at least two maximal
  literals!

- New output levels:
  0 - Nothing
  1 - As currently
  2 - Just the proof (don't know how...)
  3 - A subset of all steps
  4 - All inferences
  5 - Additional information like subsumption, evaluation,...

- Agressive split! -> Done
- Agressive destructive resolution -> Done
- Literal cut-off

- Use the better data structure control we have thanks to the new
  rewriting to keep better track of ordering comparisons in literals
  and clauses.

- Found and fixed a bug in the implementation of SoS. Redo the
  corresponding test runs! Fix another bug: If a SoS clause is used in
  simplification, then the child is SoS! Fix for E 0.71!
