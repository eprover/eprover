The E Equational Theorem Prover
===============================

E is a a purely equational theorem prover for clausal logic. That
means it is a program that you can stuff a mathematical specification
(in clausal logic with equality) and a hypothesis into, and which will
then run forever, using up all of your machines resources. Very
occasionally it will find a proof for the hypothesis and tell you so
;-).

E is available as a source distribution for UNIX-variants. It installs
cleanly under all UNIX variants I could get my hands on: Various
versions of Linux/Intel and Linux/SPARC, SunOS, Solaris and HPUX.

If this already sounds exiting to you, go download your version from
http://wwwjessen.informatik.tu-muenchen.de/~schulz/WORK/eprover.html.

If not, consider the following points:

1) Won't cause a new desktop war. The program is extremely useless to
   most end users.
2) Impress your Comp. Sci. Prof!
3) High Hack Value!

E is distributed under the GNU General Public License.

Have fun!

This is the announcement for version 0.24 of E.

Newsgroups: comp.os.linux.announce
Subject: E Equational Theorem Prover version 0.24 "Yunnan" released
Summary: Announcement of availability of the E thorem prover.
Keywords: E, equational theorem proving, ATP


The E equational theorem prover version 0.24 "Yunnan" has been
released.

E is a a purely equational theorem prover for clausal logic with
equality. Thus, you can specify a mathematical problem (e.g. a
mathematical puzzle), a (small) piece of program code or some hardware
elements in clausal logic (using rules of the form "If A and B and C
then D or E or F" in a PROLOG-like syntax), and try to have the system
prove certain properties of the described structure. Be warned that
this can consume inane amounts of CPU time and memory for non-trivial
problems.

As an example, the following piece of specification (PUZ003-1 from the
TPTP v2.1.0 problem library for theorem provers) describes a barber
club where a certain rule about shaving exist, namely, that each
member who shaves a member will be shaved by all members in turn.


shaved(members, X) <-
    member(X),
    member(Y),
    shaved(X, Y).

shaved(Y, X) <-
    shaved(members, X),
    member(Y).

member(guido) <- .

member(lorenzo) <- .

member(petruchio) <- .

member(cesare) <- .

shaved(guido, cesare) <- .


If you add the following query, the prover will prove (in about 0.03
seconds on a 143 MHz UltraSparc 1) that Petrucio shaved Lorenzo:


<- shaved(petruchio, lorenzo).


E is based on a variant of the the superposition calculus described by
Bachmair and Ganzinger, and is especially useful for problems
containing equality. Version 0.24 "Yunnan" is the first stable and
hopefully bug-free release that can deal efficiently with full clausal
logic. It is still very much work in progress, and new versions should
be released soon.

The program is available as a source distribution for UNIX-like
systems. It installs cleanly under all UNIX variants I could get my
hands on: Various versions of GNU/Linux for Intel and SPARC, SunOS,
Solaris and HPUX. The prover is distributed under the GNU General
Public License.

You can get the latest stable release from
http://wwwjessen.informatik.tu-muenchen.de/~schulz/WORK/eprover.html.

E is a a purely equational theorem prover for clausal logic with
equality. Thus, you can specify a mathematical problem (e.g. a
mathematical puzzle), a (small) piece of program code or some hardware
elements in clausal logic (using rules of the form "If A and B and C

prove certain properties of the described structure. Be warned that
this can consume inane (in fact, theoretically unlimited) amounts of
CPU time and memory for diffcult problems.

E version 0.3. is the most polished version released so far. It now
features a special mode to allow the prover to select all parameters
automatically, so that even new users can get some use out of it. E
0.3 has been tested on all 3275 CNF problems of the TPTP problem
library for theorem provers, and showed no unexpected
behaviour. Results are available from the E web page.

this can consume inane (in fact, theoretically unlimited) amounts of
CPU time and memory for diffcult problems.

Version 0.31 improves on the previous version in a variety of ways:

- The inference engine is much faster.
- The automatic mode for selecting search heuristics has been
  improved.
- When memory is low, the prover will now discard some clauses with
  very bad evaluations. This makes it possible to get good results
  even with low to medium amounts of memory (32 MB should work fine
  even for many hard proof problems).
- The prover can now read and write native TPTP format in addition to
  E-LOP.
- Various minor changes.

E 0.99 "Singtom" is the latest version of the successful theorem
prover for first order logic.

E is a a purely equational theorem prover for full first order logic
with equality. It has successfully competed in several CASC
competitions and is generally considered a friendly and powerful
system (as theorem provers go).

The new version has (again) improved heuristics and search behaviour,
better proof object generation, better clause splitting, and updates
to comply with the latest TPTP-3 syntax.

E is available as a source distribution for UNIX-variants. It installs
cleanly under all UNIX variants I could get my hands on: Various
versions of GNU/Linux for Intel and SPARC, Solaris, HPUX and
MacOS-X. Users have reported successful builds on a large number of
other systems, including Windows/Cygwin.

Subject: E Equational Theorem Prover 1.9.1 "Sungma" Released


E 1.9.1 "Sungma" is the latest version of the successful automated

E is a theorem prover for full first order logic with equality. It has
successfully competed in several CASC competitions and is generally
considered a friendly and powerful system (as theorem provers go). E
has won the "overall best system" special award at CASC-J5 and the CNF
category at CASC-23. It scored good placements at CASC-25 and CASC-J7
and is used a component in several other systems.

Major user-visible improvements of E 1.9.1 are improved automatic
modes, automatic detection of input format, major fixes to the
watchlist mechanism (especially with respect to using it to provide
hints for proof search) and a bug-fix for a rarely triggered, but
nasty bug in clausification. We recommend all users of older versions
to upgrade to E 1.9.1.

E is available as a source distribution for UNIX-variants. It
installed cleanly under all UNIX variants I could get my hands on:
Various versions of GNU/Linux for Intel, and XScale, Solaris on SPARC,
and MacOS-X (with both GNU gcc and LLVM). Users have reported
successful builds on a large number of other operating systems,
including Windows/Cygwin.

The system is dual-licensed under the GNU General Public License and
the GNU Lesser General Public License.

We expect this to be the last full release of E that does not support
many-sorted logic. We will release a preliminary experimental version
from the E 2.0 development branch with support for TPTP-3 TFF
shortly. Thanks to Simon Cruanes for making that possible. Note that
the official and stable release for E 2.0 is a while off - if you do
not need support for TFF or future experimental features, we recommend
that you stick with E 1.9.1 for the moment.

From: schulz@eprover.org (Stephan Schulz)
Subject: E Equational Theorem Prover 2.0 "Turzum" Released


E 2.0 "Turzum" is the latest version of the successful automated
theorem prover.

E is a theorem prover for full first order logic with equality. It has
successfully competed in several CASC competitions and is generally
considered a friendly and powerful system (as automated theorem
provers go). E has won the "overall best system" special award at
CASC-J5 and the CNF category at CASC-23. It scored good placements at
CASC-25 and CASC-J7 and is used a component in several other systems.

E 2.0 features a number of improvements. The most significant change
is support for many-sorted first-order logic, i.e. the TPTP-3 TFF
(typed first-order form) syntax. Thanks to Simon Cruanes for making
that possible.

Other changes include:

- Improved clausification - the new algorithm can handle long and deep
  quantifier prefixes more efficiently.
- Input clauses and formulas keep their TPTP names in the proof
  object.
- More faithful modelling of Set-of-Support semantics for the
  SimulateSOS priority function
- Various internal improvements and cleanups.

E is available as a source distribution for UNIX-variants.
Historically, it installed cleanly under all UNIX variants I could get
my hands on: Various versions of GNU/Linux for Intel and XScale,
Solaris on SPARC, and MacOS-X (with both GNU gcc and LLVM). Current
versions are tested under OS-X/macOS and Linux. Users have also
reported successful builds on a large number of other operating
systems, including Windows/Cygwin.

The system is dual-licensed under the GNU General Public License and
the GNU Lesser General Public License.

You can find the source distribution and additional information at
the E website at
               http://www.eprover.org

If your prefer to live on the bleeding edge, or to contribute to E,
the prover now also lives on GitHub at

               https://github.com/eprover

Caveats:

- While E supports parsing and processing of TFF formulas and the
  standard sorts, it does not yet implement any arithmetic background
  theories.
- As a result of the change to a many-sorted logic, numerical
  constants are now parsed as constants of the appropriate sort ($int,
  $real or $rat). In particular, this means they they cannot be used
  in unsorted contexts. This is compatible with the current
  interpretation of TPTP syntax. If you need to use numerical
  constants as free, uninterpreted symbols, use the option
  --free-numbers.
